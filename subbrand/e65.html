            <h1>BMW 7 SERIES | E65</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The fourth generation of the BMW 7 Series consists of the BMW E65 and BMW E66 luxury cars. The E65/E66 was
            produced from 2001 to 2008 and is often collectively referred to as the E65. The E65 replaced the E38 7
            Series and was produced with petrol and turbo-diesel straight-six and V8 engines, along with a petrol V12
            flagship model. <br>
            The E65 was the first BMW vehicle to include the iDrive infotainment system and the controversial exterior
            styling (overseen by Chris Bangle) marked a significant departure from traditional BMW styling. Other new
            features included active anti-roll bars, a six-speed automatic transmission, an electronic Smart Key
            (dispensing with the traditional metallic key), and night vision. The 760i model also utilised the world's
            first production V12 engine to use direct injection. <br>
            In late 2008, the E65 7 Series was replaced by the F01 7 Series.

            Development and launch
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            Development for the BMW E65 7 Series began in early 1996. In early 1997, Chris Bangle delivered a brief to
            BMW's Munich and DesignworksUSA studios. After a competition between 20 designers, Adrian van Hooydonk's
            design was approved in the spring of 1998. Production specifications were frozen in January 1999 and took
            34 months from freeze to market launch.The design was patented on 16 November 2000 and
            development ended in early 2001. <br>
            The E65 was introduced at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September 2001, and launched in Europe on
            November 2001.In order to produce the E65 7 Series and other future models, the BMW Dingolfing plant
            was retooled at a cost of approximately €500,000,000.

        <h3>Exterior Styling</h3>
        <div class="content">
            Under the direction of Chris Bangle, BMW's Design Chief at the time, the BMW E65 7 Series saw a departure
            from traditional BMW exterior styling. <br>
            BMW's board of directors were keen to move the company's image into the future, and the initial styling
            sketches from 1998 by Adrian van Hooydonk were of a fastback body style - even more radical than the
            eventual production model.[15] The controversial "flame surfacing" design[16][17] greatly contrasted the
            conservative lines of its E38 predecessor. The rear end styling was nicknamed "Bangle Butt" by critics, due
            to the elongated rear bootlid. <br>
            Dimensionally the E65 7 Series is 45 mm (1.8 in) longer, 38 mm (1.5 in) wider and 60 mm (2.4 in) taller than
            the E38.[20] The wheelbase is 2,990 mm (117.7 in), an increase of 60 mm (2.4 in) over the outgoing
            model. Despite these increased dimensions, the E65 7 Series is only 15 kg (33 lb) heavier than the E38.
            <br><br>


        </div>
        <h3>Interior Styling</h3>
        <div class="content">
            The E65 contained many departures from automotive interior design conventions. BMW removed the traditional
            console mounted gear selector, replacing it with a steering-column mounted stalk in favour of two
            cup holders. The e-brake is controlled using a button on the dashboard. The seat adjustment controls
            were moved from their traditional place on the side of the seat base to the inside of the raised central
            console, which drew some criticisms. <br>
            Unlike most BMWs since 1975 (including the E65's predecessor and successor), the centre instrument panel is
            not angled towards the driver.

            Engines
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The V8 models were the first to use the then-new BMW N62 V8 engine, which was the world's first engine to
            use a continuously variable-length intake manifold.[25] It was also BMW's first V8 engine to use variable
            valve lift (Valvetronic),[26][27] replacing throttle butterflies for added response, efficiency and
            power.[28] An system using traditional throttle butterflies was also present as a backup in case of faults
            in the valvetronic system.

            The E65 was the first BMW to use the iDrive infotainment system. The system was built on the Windows CE for
            Automotive platform, and featured an interface primarily based around a central control knob. Many of the
            functions such as climate, navigation, seat heating, telephony, and car settings were incorporated into a
            single system allowing for centralised control. Early versions of iDrive were criticised for complicated
            menu structures and a steep learning curve. <br>
            The first generation of the system relied on CD media for map data. In March 2003, the maps switched to DVD
            format, a faster processor was used and a 'Menu' and 'Customisable' button were added below the control
            knob. In 2005, dedicated buttons were added to change radio stations or skip tracks and a brighter screen
            was used for the 8.8" widescreen option.

        <div class="content">
            The E65 was the flagship model[37] and the most technologically advanced car produced by BMW at the time.
            The following features were first introduced on the E65: <br>
            • Active anti-roll bars (Active Roll Stabilisation) to reduce body roll when cornering. It uses a hydraulic
            servo in the middle of the anti-roll bar to actively counteract body roll and to reduce body roll without
            the traditional trade-off in ride comfort. <br>
            • Directional headlights (Adaptive Headlights) which electronically adjust the low beam lights horizontally
            (during turns) and vertically (based on rear axle load) adjustment of the low beam. Also, the E65 was the
            first BMW available with bi-Xenon (HID) headlights. <br>
            • World's first car with an electric park brake. This could automatically activate in stop-and-go traffic
            situations and when the ignition was switched off. <br>
            • First BMW with DVD-based GPS Automotive navigation system. <br>
            • Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), however this was available in some markets on the previous generation 7
            Series (E38). <br>
            • The optional Automatic Soft Close system minimized the force required to close the doors and boot lid, and
            would completely close them if improperly closed. <br>
            • Two fibre optic electronic networks: MOST Bus (Media Orientated System Transport)[38][39] and "Byteflight"
            (safety systems bus). These busses operate at 22.5Mbit/s and 10Mbit/s respectively. Also, the I-bus, K-bus
            and P-bus were replaced by the K-CAN (Body-Controller Area Network). This increased the system speed from
            9.6kbit/s to 100kbit/s.

        <h3>High Security 7 Series (E67)</h3>
        <div class="content">
            The E67 High Security 7 Series is an armoured variant of the BMW 7 Series. The 760Li High Security was
            introduced at the 2003 Geneva Motor Show, with the 745Li High Security model released later in September
            2003. <br>
            E65 High Security models are designed to withstand attacks, and meet the requirements of the B7 weapons
            standard.[44] Security features include a detachable multi-layer laminated windscreen, a remote starting
            system, a fire extinguishing system, a fresh air system, and under-body protection. High Security models
            also feature run flat tyres, with Michelin’s PAX system; which allows continuous driving of 80 km/h (50 mph)
            for approximately 50 km (31 mi), with a puncture. <br>
            BMW offers a buyback service for High Security models up to 7 years old, which are inspected then resold to
            potential customers worldwide. A training course is also offered to owners and chauffeurs, and teaches car
            control in case of emergency situations.

        <h3>Hydrogen 7 (E68)</h3>
        <div class="content">
            The BMW Hydrogen 7 is a limited production hydrogen-fueled model. It uses a modified version of the 760Li's
            N73 V12 engine, producing 191 kW (256 bhp). Claimed fuel economy is 50 L/100 km (4.7 mpg US) and the
            hydrogen is stored as a liquid in an insulated 170 L (45 US gal) tank. Only 100 cars were made, which were
            leased to high-profile customers, in order to promote the use of hydrogen vehicles.
