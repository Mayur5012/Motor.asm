            Bugatti Type 13(1910)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The Type 13 was the first true Bugatti car. Production of the Type 13, and later Types 15, 17, 22, and 23,
            began with the company's founding in 1910 and lasted through 1920, with 435 examples produced. Most road
            cars used an eight-valve engine, though five Type 13 racers had 16-valve heads, some of the first ever
            produced. The road cars became known as pur-sang ("thoroughbred") in keeping with Ettore Bugatti's feelings
            for his designs.<br>
            The car was brought back after World War I with a multivalve engine to bring fame to the marque at Brescia.
            The production Brescia tourer also brought in much-needed cash.<br>
            Upon starting operations at his new factory in Molsheim, Bugatti refined his light shaft-driven car into the
            Type 13 racer. This included boring the engine out to 65 mm for a total of 1.4 L (1368 cc/83 in3). A major
            advance was the four-valve head Bugatti designed — one of the first of its type ever conceived. Power output
            with dual Zenith carburetters reached 30 hp (22 kW) at 4500 rpm, more than adequate for the 660-lb (300-kg)
            car. Leaf springs were now fitted all around, and the car rode on a roughly 2-m (79-in) wheelbase. Although
            having the appearance of a toy, the Bugatti Type 13 was successfully raced. It was seen at hillclimbs as
            early as 1910 looking rather out of place compared to the bulky and brutish competition. What the Type 13
            lacked in power, it made up in handling, steering, and braking. These important elements were retained
            throughout all future Bugatti designs. Top speed was at 125 km/h.<br><br <h3>Bugatti Type 23 Brescia
            Tourer(1913–1914)</h3>
            Bugatti capitalized on the racing success of the Type 13 "Brescia" with the full-production postwar Brescia
            Tourer. It used the multivalve Brescia engine, and 2,000 examples were built from 1920 through 1926, making
            it the first full-production multivalve car ever made. <br><br><br>

        <div class="head">
            Bugatti 8-cylinder line
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The early Bugatti 8-cylinder line began with the 1922 Type 30. The same basic design was used for the 1926
            Type 38 as well as the Type 40, Type 43, Type 44, and Type 49. <br><br>

            <h3>Type 30</h3>
            Produced from 1922 through 1926, the Type 30 used the 2 L (1991 cc/121 in³) engine of the Type 29 racer. It
            shared its chassis (including the axles and gearbox) with the Type 13 "Brescia". This engine went on to be
            used in the cut-cost Type 35A and Type 38. About 600 were built from late 1922 through 1926 in varying
            specifications. <br><br>
            <h3>Type 38</h3>
            The Type 38 was produced in 1926 and 1927. It used the 2 L (1991 cc/121 in³) engine from the Type 35A
            "Tecla". The supercharger from the Type 37A was later fitted, making the Type 38A. Its gearbox and brakes
            were later used in the Type 40, while its radiator and axles were shared with the Type 43. <br>
            385 examples were produced, 39 of which were supercharged 38As. <br><br>
            <h3>Type 40</h3>
            The Type 40, introduced in 1926 and produced through 1930, used the 3-valve 1.5 L (1496 cc/91 in³) engine
            first used in some Type 37s. It was an enclosed tourer or (as the Type 40A) small roadster. About 830 were
            built. <br>
            The Type 40A shared its block with the Type 40 and displaced 1.6 L (1627 cc/99 in³). All 40 Type 40As were
            built in 1930. <br><br>

            <h3>Type 43</h3>
            Another evolution of the basic 8 platform, the Type 43 borrowed the supercharged 2.3 L (2262 cc/138 in³)
            engine from the Type 35B and combined it with the basic chassis of the Type 38. The engine produced about
            120 hp (89 kW), bringing the little car to 60 mph (97 km/h) in less than 12 seconds. <br>
            The Type 43 was noted at the time as the world's first 100 mph (161 km/h) production car — in fact, it could
            hit 110 mph (177 km/h) when most fast cars could only reach 70 mph (113 km/h). 160 of these "Grand Sport"
            cars were made from 1927 through 1931, with a Type 43A roadster appearing that year and lasting through
            1932. <br><br>
            <h3>Type 44</h3>
            The Type 44 was the widest-production variant of this range, with 1,095 known. A larger and sometimes
            enclosed tourer, it used a new 3-valve SOHC 3 L (2991 cc/182 in³) engine derived from the Type 43's unit. It
            was built from late 1927 through 1930. <br><br>

            <h3>Type 49</h3>
            The Bugatti Type 49 was an enclosed touring car similar to the earlier Type 44. Produced from 1930 through
            1934, about 470 examples were built. The Type 49 was the last of the early 8-cylinder Bugatti line which
            began with the Type 30, though its gearbox would later be reused on the Type 55. <br>
            The Type 49 featured a straight-8 engine of 3.3 L (3257 cc/198 in³) displacement. Bore and stroke were 72 mm
            by 100 mm and three valves per cylinder were used with a single overhead camshaft. <br><br><br>

            Bugatti Royale(1927–1933)
        </div>
            <div class="content">
            The Bugatti Type 41, better known as the Royale, is a large luxury car built from 1927 to 1933 with a 4.3 m
            (169.3 in) wheelbase and 6.4 m (21 ft) overall length. It weighs approximately 3,175 kg (7,000 lb) and uses
            a 12.763 litre (778 cu in) straight-eight engine. For comparison, against the Rolls-Royce Phantom VII
            (produced from 2003 onward), the Royale is about 20% longer, and more than 25% heavier. This makes the
            Royale one of the largest cars in the world. <br>
            Ettore Bugatti planned to build twenty-five of these cars and sell them to royalty as the most luxurious car
            ever, but even European royalty were not buying such things during the Great Depression, and Bugatti was
            able to sell only three of the seven made (six still exist, one destroyed in wreck). <br> <br><br>

            <div class="head">
                Bugatti Type 46(1929–1939)
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                The Bugatti Type 46 and later Type 50 were large enclosed touring cars and along with the Type 50B
                racing version, were all produced in the 1930s. Their relative ubiquity and numbers, combined with their
                styling caused them to sometimes receive the appellation of being a Molsheim Buick. <br><br>
                <h3>Type 46</h3>
                The Type 46 used a 5.4 L (5359 cc/327 in³) straight-8 engine with 3 valves per cylinder driven by a
                single overhead camshaft. Power was reported at 140 hp (104 kW). The engine was undersquare like most
                Bugatti designs with an 81 mm bore and 130 mm stroke. <br>
                The Type 46 was a large car, weighing 2500 lb (1134 kg) and riding on a 138 in (3505 mm) wheelbase. 400
                examples were produced from the end of 1929 through 1936. The three speed gearbox was in unit with the
                live rear axle, resulting in high unsprung weight, and a relatively harsh ride. Despite this, the model
                was a favourite of Le Patron, and it remained in production longer than might have been expected. <br>
                <h3>Type 46S </h3>
                A supercharged version, the Type 46S, was introduced in 1930. With just 160 hp (119 kW), from its
                Rootes-type blower, it was not a great success. 18 supercharged cars were made in all. <br><br>
                <h3>Type 50</h3>
                The Type 50 was a sporting coupe version of the Type 46. It rode on a shorter wheelbase, 122 in (3099
                mm), and used a smaller 5.0 L (4972 cc/303 in³) version of the engine. This engine had squarer
                dimensions, however, at 86 by 107 mm, and twin camshafts actuated two valves per cylinder. Power output
                was impressive at 225 hp (167 kW). Many cars had landaulet roofs and Bugatti-style two-tone paint.
                <br><br>
                <h3>Type 50T</h3>
                The Type 50 Touring was a sedan version of the Type 50. It used the same 138 in (3505 mm) wheelbase as
                its predecessor, the Type 46, but shared the 5.0 L engine of the Type 50. The engine was tuned for
                torque, though, with just 200 hp (149 kW) on tap. In total, 65 Type 50 and Type 50T Bugattis were
                produced between 1930 and 1934. <br><br>
                <h3>Type 50B</h3>
                A racing version, the Type 50B, was also produced. It shared the 5.0 L 2-valve engine but was blown to
                produce 470 hp (350 kW). It was used from 1937 through 1939. A pair of these engines were installed in
                the Bugatti P100 airplane, with specially cast magnesium crankcases. <br><br><br>

            </div>
            <div class="content">
                The Type 55 was introduced at the 1931 Paris Motor Show and that particular car, chassis 55201, was
                subsequently purchased by the Duke of Tremoille. It was available starting in 1932 and was produced
                until 1935, with the last car being delivered on July 30th of that year. 38 cars were produced in total.
                The majority of Type 55s had factory bodywork designed by Jean Bugatti, with 16 of the 38 wearing
                2-seater roadster bodies and another 7 wearing coupe bodies, both of his design. Of the other 15, 11
                were bodied by outside coachbuilders and the other four are unidentified. None of the factory bodied
                cars had doors which made them far less practical than the cars bodied by external coachbuilders, most
                of which did have doors. The Type 55 was often criticized by reviewers for its lack of practicality and
                for being deafening to ride in, due to a combination of noisy mechanicals and straight cut gears.

                Bugatti Type 57(1934–1940)
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                The Bugatti Type 57 and later variants (including the famous Atlantic and Atalante) was an entirely new
                design created by Jean Bugatti, son of founder Ettore. Type 57s were built from 1934 through 1940, with
                a total of 710 examples produced. <br>
                Type 57s used a twin-cam 3,257 cc engine based on that of the Type 49 but heavily modified by Jean
                Bugatti, unlike the single cam engines of the Type 49 and earlier models. The engines of the Type 50, 51
                used bevel gears at the front of the engine to transmit power from the crankshaft, whereas the Type 57
                used a train of spur gears at the rear of the engine, with fiber gear wheels on the camshafts to achieve
                more silence in operation. <br>
                    There were two basic variants of the Type 57 car: <br>
                    • The original Type 57 <br>
                    • The lowered Type 57S/SC <br>
                    The Type 57 chassis and engine was revived in 1951 as the Bugatti Type 101. A rediscovered Type 57
                    sold for 3.4 million euros at auction on 7 February 2009 at a motor show in Paris. <br><br>
                    <h3>Type 57</h3>
                    The original Type 57 was a touring car model produced from 1934 through 1940. It used the 3.3 L
                    (3,257 cc; 198 cu in) engine from the Type 59 Grand Prix cars, producing 135 hp (100 kW). Top speed
                    was 153 km/h (95 mph). <br>
                    It rode on a 3,302 mm (130 in) wheelbase and had a 1,349 mm (53 in) wide track. Road-going versions
                    weighed about 950 kg (2,090 lb). Hydraulic brakes replaced the cable-operated units in 1938, a
                    modification Ettore Bugatti hotly contested. 630 examples were produced. <br>
                    The original road-going Type 57 included a smaller version of the Royale's square-bottom horseshoe
                    grille. The sides of the engine compartment were covered with thermostatically-controlled shutters.
                    It was a tall car, contrary to the tastes of the time. <br>
                    Dimensions:<br>
                    • Wheelbase: 3,302 mm (130 in) <br>
                    • Track: 1,349 mm (53 in) <br>
                    • Weight: 950 kg (2,090 lb) <br><br>
                    <h3>Type 57T</h3>
                    The "tuned" Type 57T pushed the performance of the basic Type 57. It was capable of reaching 185
                    kilometres per hour (115 mph). <br><br>
                    <h3>Type 57C</h3>
                    A Type 57C racing car was built from 1937 through 1940, with about 96 produced. It shared the 3.3 L
                    engine from the road-going Type 57 but produced 160 hp (119 kW) with a Roots-type supercharger
                    fitted. <br><br>
                    <h3>Type 57C Tank</h3>
                    The 2nd incarnation Tank, this time based on the Type 57C, won Le Mans again in 1939. Shortly
                    afterwards, Jean Bugatti took the winning car for a test on the Molsheim-Strasbourg road. Swerving
                    to avoid a drunken bicyclist on the closed road, Bugatti crashed the car and died at age 30.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Type 57S/SC</h3>
                    The Type 57S/SC variants are some of the most iconic Bugatti cars. The "S" stood for "Surbaissé"
                    ("Lowered") and the "C" for "Compresseur" (a supercharger introduced by Bugatti as a result of
                    customers' desire for increased power). It included a V-shaped dip at the bottom of the radiator and
                    mesh grilles on either side of the engine compartment. <br>
                    Lowering the car was a major undertaking. The rear axle now passed through the rear frame rather
                    than riding under it, and a dry-sump lubrication system was required to fit the engine under the new
                    low hood. The 57S had a nearly-independent suspension in front, though Ettore despised that notion.
                    <br>
                    Just 43 "Surbaissé" cars[5] and only two supercharged Type 57SC's were originally manufactured. But
                    most 57S owners wanted the additional power afforded by the blower. Therefore, most of the original
                    Type 57S cars returned to Molsheim for the installation of a supercharger, pushing output from 175
                    hp (130 kW) to 200 hp (150 kW) and 190 km/h (120 mph). <br>
                    Dimensions: <br>

                The Bugatti Type 101 is a motor car made by Bugatti in 1951 and 1952 (one was built in 1965). In order
                to restart production after World War II and the deaths of Ettore Bugatti and his son Jean, the Type 101
                was developed from the pre-war Type 57. Seven chassis were built; these were bodied by four different
                coachbuilders: Gangloff [de], Guilloré, Antem and Ghia, the last to a design by Virgil Exner. The 101
                was powered by the 3.3 L (3,257 cc or 199 cu in) straight-8 from the Type 57. <br><br><br>

                Bugatti Veyron(2005–2015)
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                The Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is a mid-engine sports car, designed and developed in Germany by the Bugatti
                Engineering GmbH and manufactured by the Bugatti Automobiles SAS in Molsheim, France. The Veyron's
                fundamental concept is based on a technical draft of Bugatti chief engineer and "Technical Guru" Frank
                Götzke and it was named after the racing driver Pierre Veyron. <br>
                The original version has a top speed of 407 km/h (253 mph). It was named Car of the Decade and best car
                award (2000–2009) by the BBC television programme Top Gear. The standard Bugatti Veyron also won Top
                Gear's Best Car Driven All Year award in 2005. <br>
                The Super Sport version of the Veyron is one of the fastest street-legal production cars in the world,
                with a top speed of 431.072 km/h (267.856 mph). The Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse was the fastest roadster
                in the world, reaching an averaged top speed of 408.84 km/h (254.04 mph) in a test on 6 April 2013. <br>
                The Veyron's chief designer was Hartmut Warkuß and the exterior was designed by Jozef Kabaň of
                Volkswagen, with much of the engineering work being conducted under the guidance of chief technical
                officer Wolfgang Schreiber. The Veyron includes a sound system designed and built by Burmester
                Audiosysteme. <br>
                Several special variants have been produced. In December 2010, Bugatti began offering prospective buyers
                the ability to customise exterior and interior colours by using the Veyron 16.4 Configurator application
                on the marque's official website. The Bugatti Veyron was discontinued in late 2014, but special edition
                models continued to be produced until 2015. <br><br>
                <h3>Specifications and performance</h3>
                The Veyron features an 8.0-litre, quad-turbocharged, W16 cylinder engine, equivalent to two narrow-angle
                V8 engines bolted together. Each cylinder has four valves for a total of 64, but the configuration of
                each bank allows two overhead camshafts to drive two banks of cylinders so only four camshafts are
                needed. The engine is fed by four turbochargers and displaces 7,993 cc (487.8 cu in), with a square 86
                by 86 mm (3.39 by 3.39 in) bore and stroke. <br><br>
                The transmission is a dual-clutch direct-shift computer-controlled automatic transmission having seven
                gear ratios, with magnesium paddles behind the steering wheel and a shift time of less than 150
                milliseconds, built by Ricardo of England rather than Borg-Warner, who designed the six speed DSG used
                in the mainstream Volkswagen Group marques. The Veyron can be driven in either semi-automatic or
                fully-automatic mode. A replacement transmission for the Veyron costs just over US$120,000. <br> It also
                has permanent all-wheel drive using the Haldex Traction system. It uses special Michelin PAX run-flat
                tyres, designed specifically to accommodate the Veyron's top speed, and cost US$25,000 per set. The
                tyres can be mounted on the wheels only in France, a service which costs US$70,000. Kerb weight is 1,888
                kg (4,162 lb). This gives the car a power-to-weight ratio, according to Volkswagen Group's figures, of
                530 PS (390 kW; 523 hp) per ton. The car's wheelbase is 2,710 mm (106.7 in). Overall length is 4,462 mm
                (175.7 in) which gives 1,752.6 mm (69.0 in) of overhang. The width is 1,998 mm (78.7 in) and height
                1,204 mm (47.4 in). The Bugatti Veyron has a total of ten radiators: <br>
                • 3 heat exchangers for the air-to-liquid intercoolers. <br>
                • 3 engine radiators. <br>
                • 1 for the air conditioning system. <br>
                • 1 transmission oil radiator. <br>
                • 1 differential oil radiator. <br>
                • 1 engine oil radiator. <br>
                It has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.41 (normal condition) and Cd=0.36 (after lowering to the ground), and
                a frontal area of 2.07 m2 (22.3 sq ft). This gives it a drag area, the product of drag coefficient and
                frontal area, of CdA=0.74 m2 (8.0 sq ft). <br><br>
                <h3>Engine power output</h3>
                According to Volkswagen Group and certified by TÜV Süddeutschland, the W16 engine utilised by the Veyron
                has a power output of 736 kW (987 hp; 1,001 PS), and generates 1,250 N⋅m (922 lbf⋅ft) of torque.
                <br><br>
                <h3> Top speed</h3>
                German inspection officials recorded an average top speed of the original version at 408.47 km/h (253.81
                mph) during test sessions on Volkswagen Group's private Ehra-Lessien test track on 19 April 2005. <br>
                This top speed was almost matched by James May on Top Gear in November 2006, at the Ehra-Lessien test
                track, at 407.5 km/h (253.2 mph). May noted that at top speed the engine consumes 45,000 L (9,900 imp
                gal) of air per minute (as much as a human breathes in four days). Back in the Top Gear studio,
                co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson commented that most sports cars felt like they were shaking apart at their
                top speed, and asked May if that was the case with the Veyron at 407 km/h (253 mph). May responded that
                the Veyron was very controlled, and only wobbled slightly when the air brake deployed. <br>
                The car's normal top speed is listed at 343 km/h (213 mph). When the car reaches 220 km/h (137 mph),
                hydraulics lower the car until it has a ground clearance of about 9 cm (3.5 in). At the same time, the
                wing and spoiler deploy. In this handling mode, the wing provides 3,425 newtons (770 lbf) of downforce,
                holding the car to the road. <br>
                Top speed mode must be entered while the vehicle is at rest. Its driver must toggle a special top speed
                key to the left of their seat, which triggers a checklist to establish whether the car and its driver
                are ready to attempt to reach 407 km/h (253 mph). If so, the rear spoiler retracts, the front air
                diffusers shut, and normal 12.5 cm (4.9 in) ground clearance drops to 6.5 cm (2.6 in). <br><br>
                <h3>Braking</h3>
                The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, radially vented carbon fibre reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC)
                composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, which have less brake fade and weigh less than standard
                cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the
                front have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum
                deceleration of 1.3 g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, in the event of brake failure, an
                anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake. <br>
                Prototypes have been subjected to repeated 1.0 g braking from 312 km/h (194 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph)
                without fade. With the car's acceleration from 80 km/h (50 mph) to 312 km/h (194 mph), that test can be
                performed every 22 seconds. At speeds above 200 km/h (124 mph), the rear wing also acts as an airbrake,
                snapping to a 55° angle in 0.4 seconds once brakes are applied, providing an additional 0.68 g (6.66
                m/s2) of deceleration (equivalent to the stopping power of an ordinary hatchback). Bugatti claims the
                Veyron will brake from 400 km/h (249 mph) to a standstill in less than 10 seconds, though distance
                covered in this time will be half a kilometre (third of a mile).

                Bugatti Chiron(2016–Present)
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti
                Engineering GmbH and manufactured in Molsheim, France by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti
                Automobiles S.A.S.. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron, the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva Motor
                Show on 1 March 2016. The car is based on the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car. <br>
                The car is named after the Monegasque driver Louis Chiron. The car shares the name with the 1999 Bugatti
                18/3 Chiron concept car. <br><br>
                <h3>Specifications and performance</h3>
                The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L) quad-turbocharged W16 engine,
                though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp;
                1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm. The
                engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp;
                300 PS) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499
                PS) less power. <br>
                Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent
                suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system. The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per
                degree. <br>
                The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200
                km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting
                test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed
                9.4 seconds to brake to standstill. <br>
                The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph)
                without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as the manufacturer
                concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the
                Chiron is capable of achieving. Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily
                attain its limited top speed. Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg imp; 10.45 mpg US).

                <h2>Variants</h2>
                <h3>Chiron Sport (2018–present)</h3>
                At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti unveiled the track focused version of the Chiron, named the
                Chiron Sport. Mechanically the car is identical to the regular version, generating 1,103 kW (1,479 hp;
                1,500 PS) from a quad-turbocharged W16 engine but is 18 kg (40 lb) lighter due to the extensive use of
                carbon fibre and has a stiffer suspension in order to increase the cornering ability of the car while
                maintaining its grand touring characteristics. The steering wheel of the car has also received
                modifications and a torque vectoring system to control the power sent to each wheel of the car for
                improved handling in tight corners has been added. Aerodynamic improvements and light weight have been
                given special consideration in order to keep the car competitive on the race track. The Chiron Sport
                became available in late 2018 for an additional US$400,000 on the standard Chiron. <br><br>
                <h3>110 Ans Bugatti (2019–present) </h3>
                Introduced in February 2019, the 110 Ans Bugatti is a limited edition variant of the Chiron Sport
                developed to celebrate 110 years of Bugatti. The car features carbon fibre bodywork finished in matte
                Steel Blue exterior colour. The body is also accented with Steel Blue bare carbon fibre. The exhaust
                system of the car is finished in matte black colour. <br>
                The colours of the French flag are present on the wing mirrors, fuel filler cap and on the underside of
                the rear wing. The brake calipers are finished in blue colour. <br>
                The interior of the car is upholstered in blue Alcantara and also has the colours of the French flag
                present on the headrests of the seats, on the back of the seats and on top of the steering wheel.
                Production will be limited to 20 units. <br><br>
                <h3>Les Légendes du Ciel (2020-present</h3>
                Introduced in November 2020, the "Les Légendes du Ciel" Chiron is a limited edition version of the
                Chiron Sport developed to celebrate Bugatti's racing drivers that flew in the French Air Force. <br>
                The car features a new grill, a French flag behind the front wheels, a matte grey ("Gris Serpent")
                exterior color with a gloss white stripe in the center. <br>
                The interior is upholstered in tan leather and turned aluminum. <br>
                Production will be limited to 20 units at €2.88 million each. <br><br>
                <h3>Chiron Super Sport 300+ (2020–present) </h3>
                On 2 August 2019 Bugatti presented a limited production high performance variant of the Chiron called
                the Chiron Super Sport 300+ to owners taking part in the company's 110th-anniversary tour in Europe. The
                variant is limited to 30 examples and closely resembles the prototype performing the top speed record
                run. Changes from the standard Chiron include a more powerful engine, increased top speed, and a
                characteristic paint scheme featuring a lacquer-coated carbon fibre body with orange stripes, echoing
                the aesthetics of company's previous top speed record-breaking cars, the Veyron Super Sport World Record
                Edition and the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse World Record Car. <br>
                The car is powered by a 1,175 kW (1,580 hp; 1,600 PS) quad-turbocharged W16 engine shared with the
                Bugatti Centodieci, nicknamed "Thor". This car has a grey Bugatti logo made of black enamel and silver,
                the exhaust system from the Centodieci, a modified gearbox with longer ratios and front and rear bumpers
                optimised for aerodynamics at high speed, resulting in the overall length increase of the car by 248.9
                mm (9.8 in). <br>
                The Super Sport will also be equipped with a top speed limiter, akin to the one found in the standard
                Chiron. Without the limiter, Bugatti claims that the car can attain a maximum speed in excess of 483
                km/h (300 mph). Bugatti will also prepare the cars of owners who want to take the car to its full
                potential at the Ehra-Lessien test track. <br><br>
                <h3>Chiron Pur Sport (2020–present) </h3>
                On 3 March 2020, Bugatti introduced the Chiron Pur Sport, a handling-focused model which will be limited
                to 60 units. The tachometer has an additional 200 rpm, increasing the redline to 6,900 rpm. 80 percent
                of the transmission has been revised for a 15 percent closer gear-ratio spread benefiting the power
                band. The Pur Sport is 50 kg (110 lb) lighter than the standard Chiron due to a lightweight 3D printed
                titanium exhaust, a fixed rear spoiler and extensive use of Alcantara, anodized aluminium and titanium
                on the interior. The wheels have special spokes called "aero blades" which are designed to channel
                turbulent air near the wheel down the side of the vehicle to the rear diffuser. The tyres are Michelin
                Sport Cup 2R increasing lateral grip by 10 percent, and were co-developed with Michelin. To improve
                handling, the springs were made 65 percent stiffer at the front and 33 percent at the rear, aided by
                revised damper tuning and wheel camber along with additional front and rear carbon-fibre anti-roll bars
                and a new Sport+ drive mode. Production of the Pur Sport is expected to start in late 2020. <br><br>
                <h3>Chiron Noire (2020–present) </h3>
                Bugatti announced a special-edition, the Chiron Noire, celebrating the 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Coupé Aero
                No. 57453 (also known as "La Voiture Noire") following the 2019 one-off homage and namesake "La Voiture
                Noire". The special edition comes in two versions, the Noire Élégance (black exposed carbon body) and
                the Noire Sportive (black exposed carbon body covered with a matte black finish). Only 20 will be made.
                The Noire starts at around $3.3 million, and deliveries are expected to begin in mid-2020. The Chiron
                Noire package is available for the entry-level Chiron or the Chiron Sport, in this case at an extra
                charge of €100,000. <br><br>
                <h2>Bugatti La Voiture Noire</h2>
                The La Voiture Noire is a one-off special introduced at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. Based on the Chiron,
                the design of the car harkens back to the Type 57 SC Atlantic and is a celebration of the company's
                distinctive design history. The car has a hand-built body made from carbon fibre designed by Bugatti
                designer Etienne Salomé which has an elongated nose (similar to that on the Divo) and an elongated rear
                section. Other notable features include unique wing mirrors, LED taillight strip, and wheels. Unlike the
                original, the car retains the mid-engine layout. <br>
                A trim piece running from the front of the car to the rear spoiler recalls the dorsal fin present on the
                Type 57 SC. The car features a floating windscreen and has masked A-pillars. <br>
                The La Voiture Noire will be powered by the same 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine from the Chiron
                having the same power output figures but the 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and the all-wheel-drive system
                are heavily revised in order to allow for a more relaxed driving experience. Softer dampers and a
                revised chassis contribute to the factor. The car features six exhaust pipes recalling the innovative
                design of the past. <br>
                Performance figures remain unknown but the company states that the car is likely to have a lower top
                speed and acceleration times as compared to the Chiron due to its Grand Touring nature. The car was sold
                for a price of $18.68 million, making it one of the most expensive cars built to date. <br>
                A statement made later by the company confirmed that the car on display was a concept car and that the
                final product would take two and a half years more to complete. The show car had electric motors instead
                of an engine for easy maneuverability.

                Bugatti Divo(2019-Present)
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                The Bugatti Divo is a mid-engine track-focused sports car developed and manufactured by Bugatti
                Automobiles S.A.S. The car is named after French racing driver Albert Divo, who raced for Bugatti in the
                1920s winning the Targa Florio race twice. <br><br>
                <h3>Specifications and features</h3>
                The car takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo
                concept in terms of design and has track performance as its main focus. The car includes a redesigned
                exhaust system featuring quad exhaust pipes, a 1.8 metre wide fixed rear wing (23% wider than the
                retractable wing on the Chiron), a NACA duct on the roof that channels air to the rear of the car on a
                central fin and ultimately on the rear wing for improved downforce, a large front chin spoiler, more
                refined side skirts, larger air intakes on the front, new head lamps and tail lamps, a vent in the
                bonnet for improved radiator cooling and vents on the front wheel arches to cool the brakes. <br>
                The interior in the Divo is relatively similar to the more luxurious Chiron, but has Alcantara
                upholstery and carbon-fibre trim in order to save weight. <br>
                Other notable changes include stiffer springs and dampers, carbon-fibre wiper blades and intercooler
                shroud, grooved wheel spokes, reduced sound insulation, a lighter sound system and removal of the
                storage lockers present in the doors and centre console for a weight saving of 35 kg (77 lb) over the
                Chiron Sport. The engine, a quad-turbocharged W16 unit, is retained from the Chiron along with the
                7-speed dual-clutch transmission. <br><br>
                <h3>Performance</h3>
                The car is 8.0 seconds quicker than the Chiron around the Nardò test track according to the manufacturer
                and generates 456 kg (1,005 lb) of downforce at top speed, 90 kg (198 lb) more than the Chiron. The top
                speed is, however, reduced to 380 km/h (236 mph), owing to the extra drag produced by the aerodynamic
                elements and due to excessive pressure on the tyres resulting from a lower ride height. Power output is
                unchanged from the Chiron, with 1,103 kW (1,500 PS; 1,479 hp) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft)
                of torque at from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm. Acceleration from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) is also unchanged from the
                Chiron at 2.4 seconds but the Divo has a higher lateral acceleration (1.6 g vs 1.5 g in the Chiron). The
                Divo lacks the top speed mode unlocked with a special key as present on the Chiron. The Divo also has
                the record for worst fuel efficiency. <br><br>
                <h3>Production</h3>
                The production of the Divo is limited to 40 units and the car will be built alongside the Chiron at the
                Bugatti factory. All of the 40 cars were pre-sold before the public debut to Chiron owners through
                special invitation by the dealers. The Bugatti Divo sold out in its first day of availability. In April
                2020, Divo entered its final phase of testing with deliveries beginning later in the year.

                Bugatti Centodieci(2020–Present)
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                The Bugatti Centodieci (Italian for "110") is a limited production mid-engine sports car produced by
                French automotive manufacturer Bugatti. The car is an homage to the Bugatti EB110 and a celebration of
                the Bugatti marque's 110th birthday. The Centodieci is 20 kg lighter than the Bugatti Chiron, and has a
                8,000 cc (8.0 L; 488.2 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, rated at 1,176 kW (1,600 PS; 1,578 hp) at
                7,000 rpm. Production of the Centodieci will be limited to 10 units priced at 8 million euros (~$8.9
                million) each. <br><br>

               <h3>Design</h3> 
                Based on the Chiron, the car takes design cues from the EB110 such as the five round air intakes which
                resemble a diamond and the wedge shaped design language. A small horse shoe radiator grille present
                below the headlamps further harkens back to the EB110. Narrow headlights with LED daytime running
                function and sharp grooves are used to create an aggressive appearance. The rear consists of eight tail
                lights along with matt-black quad exhaust pipes placed on either side of a large diffuser, complete with
                an underbody spoiler and a fixed overhanging rear wing. Due to the use of computer assisted 3D design
                techniques and the use of Virtual Reality technology, the design team was able to complete the design of
                the Centodieci in six months. <br><br>
                <h3>Performance</h3> 
                The Centodieci is capable of accelerating from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 2.4 seconds, 0-200 km/h (124 mph)
                in 6.1 seconds and 0-300 km/h (186 mph) in 13.1 seconds with a top speed electronically limited to 380
                km/h (240 mph). Its kerb weight is 1,976 kg (4,356 lb). <br><br>
                <h3>Production</h3>
                Only 10 units of the Centodieci will be produced. The Centodieci will be hand-built in Bugatti's
                Molsheim factory and deliveries to customers will start in 2021.
