            <h1>BMW 5 SERIES</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The BMW 5 Series is an executive car manufactured by BMW since 1972. It is the successor to the New Class
            Sedans and is currently in its seventh generation. <br>
            Initially, the 5 Series was only available in a sedan body style. The wagon/estate body style (called
            "Touring") was added in 1991 and the 5-door fastback (called "Gran Turismo") was produced from 2009 to 2017.
            The first generation of 5 Series was powered by naturally aspirated four-cylinder and six-cylinder petrol
            engines. Following generations have been powered by four-cylinder, six-cylinder, V8 and V10 engines that are
            either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. Since 1982, diesel engines have been included in the 5 Series
            range. <br>
            The 5 Series is BMW's second best-selling model after the 3 Series. On 29 January 2008, the 5 millionth 5
            Series was manufactured, a 530d sedan in Carbon Black Metallic. <br>
            BMW's three-digit model naming convention began with the first 5 Series, thus the 5 Series was BMW's
            first model line to use "Series" in the name. <br>
            Since the E28, all generations of 5 Series have included an "M" model, called the BMW M5. <br><br><br>

            1. E12 | First generation (1972–1981)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The E12 is the first generation of 5 Series, which was produced from 1972 to 1981. It replaced the New Class
            sedans and was produced in the sedan body style. The initial models were powered by four-cylinder engines,
            with a six-cylinder engine being introduced a year later. <br>
            There was no M5 model for the E12, however the E12 M535i is considered to be the predecessor to the
            M5. <br>
            The E12 was replaced by the E28 in 1981, although E12 production continued until 1984 in South Africa. <br><br><br>

        <div class="content">
            The E28 is the second generation of 5 Series, which was produced from 1981 to 1988 in the sedan body style.
            It was initially produced with petrol four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines. <br>
            In 1983, a diesel engine was available for the first time in a 5 Series. The E28 was the first 5 Series with
            the centre console angled towards the driver and the option of anti-lock brakes (ABS). <br>
            The E28 M5 began the line of M5 high performance models that has continued through every generation since.
            It was powered by the S38B35 and the M88/3 six-cylinder engines. <br><br><br>

            3. E34 | Third generation (1988–1996)
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The E34 is the third generation of the 5 Series, which was produced from 1988 to 1996. It was launched in
            the sedan body style, with the range expanded in 1990 to include the "Touring" wagon/estate body style.
            The E34 was the first 5 Series to be available with the wagon body style, all-wheel drive and V8 engines. It
            also saw the introduction of stability control (ASC), traction control (ASC+T) a 6-speed manual transmission
            and adjustable damping (EDC) to the 5 Series range. <br>
            There was an unusually large range of engines fitted over its lifetime, as nine different engine families
            were used. These consisted of four-cylinder, six-cylinder and V8 petrol engines, and six-cylinder diesel
            engines. <br>
            The E34 M5 is powered by the S38 six-cylinder engine and was produced in sedan and wagon body styles. <br><br><br>

            4. E39 | Fourth generation (1995–2003)

        <div class="content">
            The E39 is the fourth generation of 5 Series, which was sold from 1995 to 2004. It was launched in the sedan
            body style, with the wagon/estate body style (marketed as "Touring") introduced in 1996. <br>
            The E39 was the first 5 Series to use aluminium components in the front suspension. The proportion of
            chassis components using aluminium significantly increased for the E39, in order to reduce weight. It was
            also the first 5 Series where a four-cylinder diesel engine was available. <br>
            V8 models use recirculating ball steering (as per previous 5 Series generations), however rack and pinion
            steering was used for the first time, in the four-cylinder and six-cylinder models. Unlike its E34
            predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive. <br>
            The E39 M5 sedan was introduced in 1998, powered by the 4.9-litre S62 V8 engine. <br><br><br>

        <div class="content">
            The E60/E61 is the fifth generation of the 5 Series, which was sold from 2003 to 2010. The body styles of
            the range are: <br>

            • 5-door estate/wagon (E61 model code, marketed as "Touring") <br>
            The E60 generation introduced various new electronic features to the 5 Series, including iDrive, head-up
            display, active cruise control, active steering and voice control. The E60 also was the first 5 Series to be
            available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking. New
            safety features for the E60 included adaptive headlights, night vision, active headrests, Lane Departure
            Warning and high intensity emergency brake lights. <br>
            The E60/E61 M5 was released in 2005 and is powered by the S85 V10 engine. It was sold in the sedan and wagon
            body styles, with most cars using a 7-speed automated manual transmission ("SMG III"). <br><br><br>

            The BMW F10/F11/F07/F18 is the sixth generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was produced from 2010 to

            • 4-door long wheelbase sedan (F18, sold only in China and the Middle East) <br>
            The F07 Gran Turismo is the only 5 Series to date that has been produced in a fastback body style. The F10
            is also the first 5 Series to offer a hybrid drivetrain, a turbocharged V8 engine, an 8-speed automatic
            transmission, a dual-clutch transmission (in the M5), active rear-wheel steering (called "Integral Active
            Steering"), electric power steering, double-wishbone front suspension, an LCD instrument cluster (called
            "Black Panel Display") and automatic parking (called "Parking Assistant"). <br>
            The F10 M5 is powered by the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. It is the
            first M5 to use a turbocharged engine. <br><br><br>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The BMW G30/G31/G38 is the seventh generation of the 5 Series. It was officially announced in October 2016,
            and sales began in February 2017. <br>
            The body styles of the range are: <br>
            • 4-door sedan/saloon (G30) <br>
            • 5-door wagon/estate (G31) <br>
            • 4-door long-wheelbase saloon (G38) <br>
            The fastback 5 Series GT model from the previous generation is no longer part of the model range, because it
            has been moved to the 6 Series model range. <br>
            The G30 is based on the same modular platform as the 7 Series (G11). BMW plans to release a saloon- and
            estate-style plug-in hybrid, the 530e iPerformance, which would have the advanced driver-assistance systems
            found in the 7 Series. <br>
            The F90 M5 is the M5 performance model for the G30 generation, and is the first M5 to employ an all-wheel
            drive powertrain. It is powered by an upgraded version of the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine used in the previous
            generation F10 M5. <br><br><br><br><br>
