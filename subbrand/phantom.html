            Rolls-Royce Phantom I
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The Rolls-Royce Phantom was Rolls-Royce's replacement for the original Silver Ghost. Introduced as the New
            Phantom in 1925, the Phantom had a larger engine than the Silver Ghost and used pushrod-operated overhead
            valves instead of the Silver Ghost's side valves. <br>
            The Phantom was built in Derby, England, and Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States. There were
            several differences in specification between the English and American Phantoms. <br>
            The Phantom was replaced by the Phantom II in 1929. The designation Phantom I was never used by Rolls-Royce;
            it is a construct of enthusiasts applied to help distinguish it from other generations with the same model
            name. <br> <br>
            <h3>Name</h3>
            Introduced in 1925, the New Phantom was Rolls-Royce's second 40/50 hp model. To differentiate between the
            40/50 hp models, Rolls-Royce named the new model "New Phantom" and renamed the old model "Silver Ghost"
            [Incorrect, just like the so-called 'Gullwing' Mercedes-Benz, the company never referred to the first 40/50
            hp model as the 'Silver Ghost'; this only came about later on account of the relative fame that the 'Silver
            Ghost' motorcar, AX201, chassis number 60551, received], which was the
            name given to their demonstration example, Registration No. AX201. When the New Phantom was replaced by
            another 40/50 hp model in 1929, the replacement was named Phantom II and the New Phantom was renamed Phantom
            I.
            <h3>Drivetrain</h3>
            One major improvement over the Silver Ghost was the new pushrod-OHV straight-6 engine.Constructed as
            two groups of three cylinders with a single detachable head,[3] the engine was described by Rolls-Royce as
            producing "sufficient" power.The engine used a 4¼ in (107.9 mm) bore and undersquare 5½ in (139.7 mm)
            stroke for a total of 7.7 L (7,668 cc (467.9 cu in)) of displacement. In 1928, the cylinder heads were
            upgraded from cast iron to aluminium; this caused corrosion problems. The separate gearbox connected through
            a rubberised fabric flexible coupling to the clutch and through a torque tube enclosed drive to the
            differential at rear, as in the Silver Ghost. <br> <br>
            <h3>Chassis</h3>
            The New Phantom used the same frame as the Silver Ghost, with semi-elliptical springs suspending the
            front axle[5] and cantilever springs suspending the rear axle. 4-wheel brakes with a servo-assistance
            system licensed from Hispano-Suiza were also specified, though some early US models lacked front
            brakes.
            <h3>Differences between US and UK versions</h3>
            Like the Silver Ghost, the New Phantom was constructed both at Rolls-Royces' Derby factory in the United
            Kingdom and at a factory in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States. The US factory produced
            New Phantoms from 1926 to 1931. <br>
            Principal differences between the US and UK models included wheelbases and transmissions. Both versions were
            specified with the same standard 143½ in (3644.9 mm) wheelbase; the long-wheelbase U.S. model was 146½ in
            (3721.1 mm) and the UK 150½ (3822.7 mm). Both versions used a single dry-plate
            clutch, with US models equipped with a centre change 3-speed transmission and UK a
            4-speed. <br>
            Other minor differences include fuel gauge placement, with the UK New Phantom's at the tank but some US
            models having one on the dash, and manual central lubrication systems. The UK Phantom employed Enots
            nipples, some times as many as 50, which required attachment of a special Enots oil pressure gun and needed
            time-consuming service at 500, 1000 and 2000 mile intervals; the US model used a
            centralized Bijur system which lubricated all the oiling points with a stroke of a single pump. <br><br>

            <h3>Bodywork</h3>
            Wooden coachwork on a Phantom I
            Only the chassis and mechanical parts were produced by Rolls-Royce. The body was made and fitted by a
            coachbuilder selected by the owner. Coachbuilders who produced bodies for New Phantom cars included Barker,
            Park Ward, Biddle and Smart, Thrupp & Maberly, Mulliner, Hooper and the Italian coachbuilder Zagato. <br>
            American Phantoms could be bought with standardized bodies from Brewster & Co., which was owned by
            Rolls-Royce after 1926, and additional coachwork choices were available from Fleetwood. Several coachwork
            choices were listed, or just a plain chassis could be provided for US$13,335 ($198,552 in 2019 dollars) A
            fendered chassis was also available, while coachwork choices were listed by different city names in England:
            These include the Derby Touring Sedan, Ascot Phaeton, York Roadster, Huntington Limousine, Henley
            Convertible, Avon Sedan, Newmarket Convertible Sedan, Chatsworth Town Car, and the French city of Trouville
            Town Car. A convertible sedan with coachwork from Hibbard & Darrin was also on offer.

        <div class="head">
            Rolls-Royce Phantom II
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The Rolls-Royce Phantom II was the third and last of Rolls-Royce's 40/50 hp models, replacing the New
            Phantom in 1929. It used an improved version of the Phantom I engine in an all-new chassis. A "Continental"
            version, with a short wheelbase and stiffer springs, was offered. <br><br>
            <h3>Drivetrain</h3>
            The Phantom II used a refinement of the Phantom I's 7.7 L (7,668 cc or 467.9 cu in) pushrod-OHV straight-6
            engine with a new crossflow cylinder head. Unlike on previous 40/50 hp models, the engine was bolted
            directly to the 4-speed manual transmission. Synchromesh was added on gears 3 and 4 in 1932 and on gear 2 in
            1935. Power was transmitted to the rear wheels using an open driveshaft, a hypoid bevel final drive, and
            Hotchkiss drive, replacing the torque tube from a remotely mounted gearbox used on earlier 40/50 hp models.
            <br> <br>
            <h3>Chassis</h3>
            The chassis of the Phantom II was completely new. The front axle was mounted on semi-elliptical leaf springs
            as on earlier 40/50 hp models, but the rear axle was now also mounted on semi-elliptical springs instead of
            cantilever springs. This, along with the drivetrain changes, allowed the frame to be lower than before,
            improving the handling. The 4-wheel servo-assisted brakes from the Phantom I were continued, and the Bijur
            centralized lubrication system from the Springfield-built Phantom I was included on all Phantom II chassis.
            <br>
            The standard wheelbase of the Phantom II was 150 inches (3,800 mm). A 144 inches (3,700 mm) short-wheelbase
            chassis was also available. <br>
            A total of 1,281 Phantom II chassis of all types were built. <br><br>
            <h3>"Continental" model</h3>
            Rolls-Royce 40-50hp Phantom II 'Continental' Sports Saloon
            Royce had body designer Ivan Evernden build him a one-off short-wheelbase Phantom. Designated 26EX, the car
            had a tuned engine, five-leaf springs that were stiffer than standard and a Barker four-seat lightweight
            close-coupled saloon body painted with an artificial pearl lacquer made from ground herring scales. The
            sales department initially showed no interest in 26EX but, when Evernden returned to the office from the
            1930 Biarritz Grand Concours d'Elegance, where 26EX had won the Grand Prix d'Honneur, he found that the
            sales department had already announced the new "Phantom II Continental Saloon", prepared a brochure for it,
            and costed it. <br>
            According to Evernden, neither he, Royce, nor the Rolls-Royce sales department had written specifications
            for the "Continental" model, although he and Royce had a clear specification in mind. Based on Evernden's
            writings and examination of company records, historian Ray Gentile determined that the common specifications
            of the Continental chassis were the short wheelbase and stiffer, five-leaf springs. By this definition, two
            hundred and eighty-one Continental Phantom II's were produced, including 125 left-hand drive versions. <br>
            Regarded as the two most important P-II Continentals are 20MS and 2SK, the only two P-II Continental
            Roadsters ever built. 20MS has been in a private Mid-Atlantic collection since 1989, 2SK, the Thrupp and
            Maberly Roadster once owned by Tyrone Power, was in the Fred Buess collection since 1958 but was sold at
            auction in 2010. <br> <br>
            <h3>US-market versions</h3>
            All Phantom II rolling chassis were built at Rolls-Royce's factory in Derby. The factory in Springfield,
            Massachusetts was closed upon ending production of the US-market Phantom I in 1931. Two US-market series,
            AJS and AMS, were built at Derby. <br>
            It competed with the recently introduced Lincoln model K, Chrysler Imperial, Mercedes-Benz 770, Duesenberg
            Model J, Packard Eight, and the Cadillac Series 355. <br><br>
            <h3>Bodywork</h3>

            Chassis #188PY (1934). This car also is known as the "Star of India". <br>
            Only the chassis and mechanical parts were made by Rolls-Royce. The body was made and fitted by a
            coachbuilder selected by the owner. Some of the most famous coachbuilders who produced bodies for Rolls
            Royce cars are Park Ward, Brewster, Thrupp & Maberly, Mulliner, Carlton, Henley, and Hooper. <br><br>

            Rolls-Royce Phantom III
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            The Rolls-Royce Phantom III was the final large pre-war Rolls-Royce. Introduced in 1936, it replaced the
            Phantom II and it was the only V12 Rolls-Royce until the 1998 introduction of the Silver Seraph. 727 V12
            Phantom III chassis were constructed from 1936 to 1939, and many have survived. Although chassis production
            ceased in 1939 (with one final chassis being built in 1940), cars were still being bodied and delivered in
            1940 and 1941. The last car, though the rolling chassis was completed in 1941, was not delivered with a body
            to its owner until 1947. The Phantom III was the last car that Henry Royce worked on - he died, aged 70, a
            year into the Phantom III's development.

            <h3>Engineering</h3>
            The III is powered by an aluminium-alloy V12 engine of 447in³ (7.32L), having a bore of 3.25 inches (82.5
            mm) and a stroke of 4.5 inches (114.3 mm). It is a pushrod engine with overhead valves operated by a single
            camshaft in the valley between the cylinder banks. Early cars had hydraulic tappets or, rather, a unique
            system of eccentric bushings in each individual rocker that was actuated by a small hydraulic piston; the
            eccentric bushing ensuring zero valve-lash at the rocker/valve interface. This system was changed to solid
            adjustable tappets in 1938. The Phantom III is unusual for its twin ignition systems, with two distributors,
            two coils and 24 spark plugs. Petrol is provided by a twin SU electric pump. Wire wheels are fitted as
            standard, but many cars carry Ace wheel discs which were fitted to improve cosmetics and to reduce the time
            taken to clean the wire wheels after use. <br>
            The car features on-board jacking and a one-shot chassis lubrication system, operated by a lever inside the
            driver's compartment. Independent front suspension by a coil spring-based system is complemented by a
            carryover semi-elliptical spring unit in the rear. The car has a 4-speed manual transmission with
            synchromesh on gears 2, 3 and 4. An overdrive gearbox was added in 1938, the ratio change being contained in
            the gearbox rather than in a separate unit. The car has 4-wheel servo-assisted brakes applied by cable
            (using a servo made under licence from Hispano-Suiza). The radiator shell is of Staybrite steel. <br>
            The sheer bulk of the car is reflected in its performance figures. An example tested in 1938 by The English
            Autocar magazine returned a top speed of 87½ mph (140 km/h) and a 0 - 60 mph (0 – 96 km/h) time of 16.8
            seconds. The overall fuel consumption quoted from that road test was 28 litres per 100 kilometres (10 mpg
            imp; 8.4 mpg US). <br><br>

            <h3>Bodywork</h3>
            Dual-cowl open tourer, 1937 by Barker & Co. <br>
            Only the chassis and mechanical parts were made by Rolls-Royce. Car bodies were constructed and fitted by
            coachbuilders selected by owners or dealers, who might have cars built for showroom stock. <br>
            Some of the most
            famous coachbuilders who produced bodies for Rolls-Royce cars are Barker, Park Ward, Mulliner, Hooper and
            Thrupp & Maberly. Body types as well as limousines included saloons, coupés, and convertibles. A handful of
            used cars have been converted to hearses and shooting brakes. <br><br>

            Rolls-Royce Phantom IV
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The Phantom IV is a British automobile produced by Rolls-Royce. Only eighteen were made between 1950 and
            1956. They were only built for buyers whom Rolls-Royce considered worthy of the distinction: the British
            Royal Family and heads of state. Sixteen are currently known to still exist in museums as well as in public
            and private collections. <br><br>

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            Kneeling Spirit of Ecstasy (1934-1939 and 1946-1956) mounted on most of the radiators, except units 15 and
            18 (chassis 4CS4). <br>
            Rolls Royce broke with their earlier decision to cease production of the series of "big" Rolls-Royce
            Phantoms after the end of World War II. The Phantom IV chassis differed from those of the shorter,
            production post-War models, the Silver Wraith and the Bentley Mark VI, apart from a larger size and an
            engine with increased capacity and power, in having an additional cross-member at the centre of the
            cruciform bracing and 10-stud road wheel mounting. The engine was a derivative of the 8-cylinder
            rationalized B range of petrol engines (formed by four, six and straight eight). Specifically it was a
            refined version of a B80, the last three of a B81, both used in military and commercial vehicles. The IV is
            the only Rolls-Royce motorcar to be fitted with a straight-8 engine, which was powerful but could also run
            long distances at a very low speed, an important feature for ceremonial and parade cars. <br>
            All examples of this exclusive series were bodied by independent coachbuilders, and most of their bonnets
            surmounted by the kneeling version of the Spirit of Ecstasy, which had been unveiled in 1934 and used in
            various other models. <br><br>

            <h3>History</h3>
            Chassis 4AF18: Two big Lucas R-100 headlights flank the emblematic Parthenon-style radiator grille. Top and
            front surfaces look dead flat but are actually a few thousandths convex, so they will look flat, in
            accordance with the design principles used by the ancient Greeks in that temple. <br>
            In July 1938 Rolls Royce had to publish in the motoring press an announcement denying that the Phantom III
            fabrication would be interrupted. The following was published on 19 July 1938 in the British magazine The
            Motor: <br>
            THE COMPANY WISH TO DENY the rumour that the Phantom III is to be discontinued and replaced with another
            model having an 8-cylinder or other engine. <br>
            However, in 1937 a project was initiated to rein in the manufacturing costs of the Rolls-Royce and Bentley
            (acquired by Rolls-Royce in 1931) motor car chassis. This involved the development of a Rationalized Range
            of cars sharing as many common components of the chassis as possible. As implementation of this
            rationalization plan, several prototypes were made. One of these, chassis 30-G-VII, was fitted with a large
            Park Ward seven-seater limousine body and was called Silver Wraith 80, then Silver Phantom, though it soon
            became known as Big Bertha. This was the genesis of the Phantom IV. <br>
            Likewise, in 1939 and before the starting of hostilities, another straight-eight powered experimental
            automobile tested during and after World War II was a special Bentley Mark V, chassis 11-B-V fitted with a
            bored-out 6.3 litre eight-cylinder engine. <br>
            Although the official Experimental Department name for this car was Comet, its scorching performance earned
            it the fond epithet Scalded Cat. This unit in particular would later play a key role in the decision of
            creating the Phantom IV. <br>
            Indeed, in 1948 the Duke of Edinburgh heard about the Bentley nicknamed Scalded Cat and asked if he might
            test it out. He enjoyed this experimental car immensely and drove it for considerable distances. When he
            returned it, he apparently murmured about how nice it would be to have a car with performance in the Royal
            Mews. On 15 November 1948, not long after Prince Philip had driven the aforementioned automobile, an order
            came through for a Rolls-Royce motor car for Their Royal Highnesses Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip.
            They placed the order through The Car Mart, Ltd., RR official retailers. Such a vehicle would have to meet
            their official needs which meant it must be a limousine, it would also have to have good performance since
            the Prince wished to drive it himself. The car would be the first Rolls-Royce in the stables. It was
            originally planned to be the only Phantom IV, a strictly one-off piece. <br>
            Rolls-Royce, aware that Daimler had held the Royal warrant to provide motor cars since 1900, was very keen
            to ensure that the car was the best there had ever been, and a great deal of hand work was lavished on the
            construction of the chassis. The board had earlier considered making a replacement for the pre-war Phantom
            III, but were wary that such a large and expensive car might not have a market in the weak post-war economy.
            Production of the first two units of the new model was not at Crewe, but at the experimental Clan Foundry at
            Belper, which had been the home of the motor car branch during the Second World War. The experimental
            department still continued there until the closure of Clan Foundry in 1950, when it was finally transferred
            to Crewe. <br>
            The chassis 4AF2 was built under the code-name Nabha and Mulliner was selected as the coachbuilder, so they
            prepared drawings for approval. The chassis, was delivered to them on 20 July 1949 for erection of the body.
            Prince Philip visited the workshops more than once while it was being built. When the automobile was
            completed in July 1950 its delivery was accompanied by a public announcement stating the Phantom IV had been
            "designed to the special order of Their Royal Highnesses, the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh".
            <br>
            As the car was privately owned when delivered to the couple it was painted Valentine green (deep green with
            a slight blue secondary hue) with red belt-line striping. The limousine became an official state car of the
            United Kingdom upon Princess Elizabeth's accession to the throne in 1952; as such, it was repainted in the
            sovereign's colour scheme of royal claret and black. It remains in the Royal Mews and is still occasionally
            used for royal and state occasions. For example, it was used at the wedding of Prince William of Wales and
            Kate Middleton to carry Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, from Clarence House to Westminster
            Abbey. In 2018 it brought Meghan Markle to St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle for her marriage to Prince
            Harry. <br>
            4AF18, one of only three open bodies made.
            <br><br>

            <h3>The Spanish Order</h3>
            On 18 October 1948, Crewe received an order from the Government of Spain for three armoured cars for the use
            of Generalissimo Francisco Franco: two with limousine bodies and an open all-weather body; this one intended
            to replace a 1936 Hispano-Suiza J12 with Carrosserie Vanvooren body. While the Phantom IV model was not
            specified in the order, or even known outside the company at that time, it was decided that the best way to
            cope with the huge additional weight would be to build the three cars as Phantom IVs, rather than
            over-burden the Silver Wraith chassis. Especially since the Foreign Office suggested that Crewe could not
            turn down the order. <br>
            The passengers were to be immune from a Mauser bullet fired at ten paces, so W. A. Robotham recommended a
            body from Mulliner’s of Chiswick who had many satisfied customers among the more unpopular rulers of the
            world. A mission to Mulliner’s of Army officers required glass one and three quarters of an inch thick and
            armour plate. The armour plate was to be almost half an inch thick ,and the large floor area required would
            make the completed weight of the cars over three and a half tons, which would overstress the wheels and
            gearbox on Spain’s main roads. Some years later when holidaying there Robotham inspected the cars; the
            brigadier in charge of the garage praised them and said they were used frequently. The speedometers only
            showed less than 2,000 km but they were taken by train and only driven for the actual inspections and
            processions. <br>
            Without intending it, the Government of Spain triple order (along with the later Duke's commission) probably
            helped to give a decisive impulse to the existence of this model, as suggested by Martin Bennett in his book
            Rolls-Royce & Bentley: The Crewe Years and the number 9 September 1990 of the British magazine Classic Cars.
            All these three historical vehicles are property of the Spanish Army and are still in ceremonial use for the
            Spanish royal family. <br><br>

            <h3>The "Royalty and Heads of State only" policy</h3>
            It is not known exactly when the "Royalty and Heads of State only" policy was decided, nor indeed whether in
            fact there was such an explicit company policy. It is known though, that a boardroom decision was reached
            that it would be impractical and disruptive to production of standard models to attempt to build more than
            three Phantom IVs per year. It is also clear that no private customer other than royalty and heads of state
            ever took delivery of a Phantom IV. Nevertheless, a considerable number of coachbuilder's drawings exist of
            proposed Phantom IVs that never were built. <br>
            A number of these are proposals by coachbuilders for chassis which in the event were bodied by other
            coachbuilders. Others were proposed but not built at all. Most are linked to a specific customer's name,
            such as the King Farouk, the Maharajas of Baroda and Mysore, as well as the Americans Briggs Cunningham and
            James Melton. It is evident that certain customers outside of the Royalty and Heads of State category
            believed that a Phantom IV would be available for purchase. Just how, or if, the news was broken to those
            customers that the firm would not supply a chassis for their proposed cars, or why they opted for other
            models, is open to conjecture. <br>
            By 1956 appropriate bodies for state use had been built on Silver Wraiths, making dedicated Phantom IV
            production no longer necessary. The model, which in spite of its luxury and exclusivity had not been very
            profitable, was discontinued, its role of expanding the prestige of Rolls-Royce having been achieved.

            Rolls-Royce Phantom V
        </div>
        <div class="content">

            The Rolls-Royce Phantom V is a large four-door limousine produced by Rolls-Royce Limited from 1959 to 1968.
            <br>Based on the Silver Cloud II, it shared a V8 engine and General Motors Hydra-Matic automatic gearbox
            with that model. Rolls-Royce assembled the cars' chassis and drivetrains with bodies made to standard
            designs by coachbuilders Park Ward, and James Young, former vendors absorbed by Rolls-Royce. <br>
            The engine was a 6,230 cc 90-degree V8 with twin SU carburetors, coupled to a 4-speed automatic
            transmission. The car had massive drum brakes and a wheelbase of 3,683 mm. A four speed automatic
            transmission and power assisted steering were standard. <br>
            A shallow gear gave a walking speed which was suitable for ceremonies. From 1963 onward, the Silver Cloud
            III's 7% more powerful engine and new front wings (incorporating the latter's quad headlamps) were fitted.

            Rolls-Royce Phantom VI
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The Rolls-Royce Phantom VI is a high end British car made from 1968 to 1990 by Rolls-Royce. A total of 374
            Phantom VIs were made, of which less than ten percent were manufactured in the last decade of production.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Construction</h3>
            1970 Rolls-Royce Phantom VI limousine, the official car used on ceremonial occasions to transport the
            Governor-General of Australia and visiting heads of state. <br>
            1992 landaulet by Mulliner Park Ward – invoice price £498,365 or in 2018 pounds £1,015,169.40 <br>
            Most of the coachwork was created by Mulliner Park Ward, usually in limousine form, although a few
            landaulets were made. <br>
            The Phantom VI was the last Rolls-Royce with a separate chassis. It featured coil springs in front, leaf
            springs and live axle in rear, and drum brakes on all four wheels. The car was powered by a 6,230 cc (380 cu
            in) 90-degree V8 with a bore of 104 mm (4.1 in) and stroke of 91.5 mm (3.60 in) with twin SU carburettors,
            coupled to a 4-speed automatic gearbox. In a 1979 upgrade the engine capacity was increased to 6,750 cc (412
            cu in), a 3-speed automatic gearbox with torque converter was substituted, and separate front and rear air
            conditioning units were provided. Inclusion of the engine from the Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit in 1982
            increased engine displacement once more, to 6,750 cc. In 1990, the last Rolls-Royce Phantom VI chassis were
            built. However, as the completion of the coachwork by Mulliner Park Ward took around 18 months, the last
            cars were made in the period of the next two years. <br><br>
            Design of a Phantom VII based on the Silver Shadow's body was discussed in the 1970s, but plans were
            scrapped. No prototypes were built. A production Rolls-Royce Phantom VII was rolled out in 2003. <br><br>

            <h3>Owners</h3>
            Queen Elizabeth II has two Rolls-Royce Phantom VIs: the Silver Jubilee Car and a more conventional 1986
            model. These two cars were the official state cars until the introduction of the two Bentley State
            Limousines in 2002. <br><br><br>

        <div class="content">
            The Rolls-Royce Phantom VII is a full-sized luxury saloon car made by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. Launched in
            2003, it was the first Rolls-Royce developed and introduced after BMW purchased the right to use the
            Rolls-Royce name and logo in 1998. <br>
            It is credited with successfully reviving the Rolls-Royce brand and restoring Rolls-Royce's reputation as a
            maker of luxury cars. <br>
            The Phantom Drophead Coupé and Phantom Coupé are two-door derivatives of the Phantom launched in 2007 and
            2008, respectively. <br>
            From 2003 until the launch of the smaller Ghost in 2009, the Phantom was the only car produced by
            Rolls-Royce. The Phantom acted as the company's flagship model, but was less exclusive than all previous
            Phantoms (none of which surpassed the 600 per year). <br><br>

            Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupé
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupé is a luxury car manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars that debuted at the
            2008 Geneva International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland, on 6 March 2008. The platform is based on the
            2003 Rolls-Royce Phantom and has styling heavily derived from the Rolls-Royce 100EX, a concept car unveiled
            to celebrate the company's centennial in 2004. Its interior includes leather and wood veneer. There is a
            button to close the "coach doors" (suicide doors). The Phantom Coupe has the same 6.75-litre (412 cu in) V12
            as found in the other Phantom models, developing 338 kW (453 bhp; 460 PS) of power and 720 N⋅m (530 lb⋅ft)
            of torque. It is the first Rolls-Royce coupe in 22 years.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Specification</h3>
            The Phantom Coupé has nearly 542 N⋅m (400 lb⋅ft) of torque, or 75 percent, available at 1,000 rpm—and has
            segment-leading fuel economy thanks to technology such as direct injection and variable valve and camshaft
            control. The car features reverse-opening power-closing doors, adaptive suspension with automatic
            four-corner levelling, 21-inch alloy wheels, a 15-speaker 420 watt sound system with navigation, and a
            handcrafted interior with flawless leather trim and a choice of wood veneers. The "picnic" boot provides a
            seating platform for two and offers easy access to the luggage compartment. Optional equipment includes
            front and rear parking cameras and a wide array of paint colours and interior trim material choices. A
            unique option is a full-length "starlight" headliner, which incorporates hundreds of tiny fibre optics to
            give the impression of a star-filled night sky. <br><br>
            <h3>Performance</h3>
            The Phantom Coupé is capable of accelerating from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 5.8 seconds and has a limited top
            speed of 155 mph (249 km/h), with a fuel consumption in combined cycle (ECE+EUDC) of 16 L/100 km (18 mpg
            imp; 15 mpg US) while producing 377 g/km of CO
            2. <br><br>
            <h3>Reception</h3>
            The Phantom Coupé has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The British television show Top Gear
            rated the car 9/10 for performance, 10/10 for quality, 9/10 for design, but criticised its high cost.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Sweptail</h3>
            The Rolls-Royce Sweptail was a one-off custom Phantom Coupé sold in 2017 for $12.8 million after a 4-year
            build making it the most expensive new car ever sold. <br><br>

            Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII is a full-sized luxury saloon manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. It is the
            eighth and current generation of the Rolls-Royce Phantom, and the second launched by Rolls-Royce under BMW
            ownership. It is offered in two wheelbase lengths. <br><br>
            <h3>Launch</h3>
            The Phantom was unveiled by live-stream on 27 July 2017.
            It made its public debut at a special exhibition Rolls-Royce held in London two days later on 29 July. The
            event, dubbed "The Great Eight Phantoms", took place at Bonhams auction house in Mayfair. The exhibition
            gathered a noteworthy Phantom from each generation, from Fred Astaire's Phantom I to subsequent models
            driven by royalty, or made famous by celebrities, including John Lennon's Romany gypsy wagon-style painted
            Phantom V. <br><br>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            The Phantom VIII's styling has been described as an evolution of the Phantom VII's. <br>
            Like its predecessor, the Phantom VIII has a short front overhang and upright front end, a long bonnet and
            set-back passenger compartment as well as a long wheelbase and a flowing rear end. It also uses rear-opening
            "coach doors". For the first time on a Phantom, Rolls-Royce's trademark "Parthenon" radiator grille is
            integrated into the surrounding bodywork. <br>
            The Phantom is available in two wheelbase lengths. The Phantom Extended Wheelbase (EWB) is 220 mm (8.7 in)
            longer than the standard wheelbase. <br><br>

            <h3>Specifications</h3>
            Platform:
            The Phantom uses an aluminium spaceframe chassis; this is a version of Rolls-Royce's modular "Architecture
            of Luxury" platform. The Phantom is the first car to be based on this new platform, which is also used by
            the Cullinan SUV and will be used by other future Rolls-Royce models. <br><br>
            Suspension and steering:
            The Phantom is fitted with self-levelling air springs and electronically controlled dampers front and rear.
            It uses a double wishbone front axle and a 5-link rear axle. It is also equipped with active anti-roll bars.
            <br>
            The suspension system is linked to a stereo camera mounted behind the windscreen. This scans the road ahead
            and preconfigures the spring and damper rates, and the anti-roll bars, so as to improve ride quality. The
            system, dubbed the "Flagbearer" by Rolls-Royce, operates at speeds of up to 100 km/h (62 mph). <br>
            The Phantom is the first Rolls-Royce to be fitted with four-wheel steering. The system turns the rear wheels
            counter to the front wheels through a maximum of 3° at speeds lower than 60 km/h (37 mph) to improve
            manoeuvrability. Between 60 and 80 km/h (37 and 50 mph) the rear wheels do not steer at all. At speeds above
            80 km/h the rear wheels turn in the same direction as the front wheels through a maximum of 1° to increase
            high-speed stability. <br>
            The Phantom uses "Silent-Seal" tyres which Rolls-Royce co-developed with Continental. These use a layer of
            foam inside the tyre to reduce tyre cavity noise, lowering sound levels in the cabin by up to 9 decibels.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Interior</h3>
            The interior is fully bespoke and personalised to the clientele like previous and current Rolls Royce models
            offer. It has the BMW iDrive infotainment system with 3D camera view. They also have "The Gallery", a
            display section in the vehicle in the front seat veneer with experimentation of different materials and
            artwork to be integrated with the vehicle and all the options are limitless. <br><br>
            <h3>Powertrain</h3>
            The Phantom is exclusively available with a twin-turbocharged 6.75-litre V12 engine. This is a variant of
            BMW's N74 called the N74B68 which is unique to the Phantom. <br>
            ZF's 8HP 8-speed automatic transmission is the sole gearbox option. This is linked to a GPS receiver which
            analyses the car's location and speed to optimise shift timing.
